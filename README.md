# Advent of Code 2024 - Learning Go Edition

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges. I am using this opportunity to learn Go, just for fun!

## About This Project

In this project, I will be solving each day's challenge using the Go programming language. My goal is to learn some Go notions and have fun along the way.

## Structure

Each day's solution will be in its own directory, named `dayXX`, where `XX` is the day number (e.g., `day01` for December 1st).
